# ErisUI

A cool UI framework. (I may come up with a better name later)
Since TeleMeow is essentially dead now I'm not gonna just let that awesome code go to waste.

I'll update the things you can do eventually.

## Forms/Text input

```
<div class="form">
    <input class="form-input" id="id" type="text" autocomplete="">
    <label for="id">Label</label>
</div>
```
